1. For the homework I was using MS SQL Database
2. You can find the table create script in the file "CreateTable.sql"
3. I removed my database credentials, so please write yours in the application.properties file
4. Please make and use new api url for your tests - the one used in the code is expired. The url must be replaced in the function ApiConnection, which is in the RoHolidaysService.java
